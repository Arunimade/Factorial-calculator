Instant Results: Get the factorial of the number instantly displayed without any delays.
Responsive Design: The calculator works smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring accessibility on the go.
Input Validation: Accepts only non-negative integers to prevent invalid input and ensure accurate results.
How to Use
Enter a Number: In the provided input field, type in a non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, 3, etc.).
Calculate: Click on the "Calculate" button to compute the factorial of the entered number.
View the Result: The result will be displayed below the form, showing you the calculated factorial.
Example
Input: 5
Output: 120 (because 5! = 5 Ã— 4 Ã— 3 Ã— 2 Ã— 1 = 120)
What is a Factorial?
The factorial of a non-negative integer nnn is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to nnn. It is denoted as n!n!n! and is defined as:

n!=nÃ—(nâˆ’1)Ã—(nâˆ’2)Ã—â€¦Ã—1n! = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times \ldots \times 1n!=nÃ—(nâˆ’1)Ã—(nâˆ’2)Ã—â€¦Ã—1
Special case: 0!=10! = 10!=1 (by definition)
Technologies Used
